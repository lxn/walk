About Walk
==========

Walk is a "Windows Application Library Kit" for the Go Programming Language.

Its primarily useful for Desktop GUI development, but there is some more stuff.

Setup
=====

Make sure you have a working Go installation.
See [Getting Started](http://golang.org/doc/install.html)

##### Note
`Go 1.0.x` doesn't work with walk anymore, Make sure you use `Go 1.1.x`

##### To Install
Now run `go get github.com/lxn/walk`

Using Walk
==========

The preferred way to create GUIs with Walk is to use its declarative sub package,
as illustrated in this small example:

##### `test.go`

	package main
	
	import (
		"github.com/lxn/walk"
		. "github.com/lxn/walk/declarative"
		"strings"
	)
	
	func main() {
		var inTE, outTE *walk.TextEdit
	
		MainWindow{
			Title:   "SCREAMO",
			MinSize: Size{600, 400},
			Layout:  VBox{},
			Children: []Widget{
				HSplitter{
					Children: []Widget{
						TextEdit{AssignTo: &inTE},
						TextEdit{AssignTo: &outTE, ReadOnly: true},
					},
				},
				PushButton{
					Text: "SCREAM",
					OnClicked: func() {
						outTE.SetText(strings.ToUpper(inTE.Text()))
					},
				},
			},
		}.Run()
	}

##### Build app

	go build test.go

##### Create Manifest `test.exe.manifest`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
        <assemblyIdentity version="1.0.0.0" processorArchitecture="*" name="SomeFunkyNameHere" type="win32"/>
        <dependency>
            <dependentAssembly>
                <assemblyIdentity type="win32" name="Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls" version="6.0.0.0" processorArchitecture="*" publicKeyToken="6595b64144ccf1df" language="*"/>
            </dependentAssembly>
        </dependency>
    </assembly>
```

##### Run app
	
	test.exe
	
##### Sample Output (Windows 7)

There are some [examples](examples) that should get you started.

Application Manifest Files
==========================
Walk requires Common Controls 6. This means that you must put an appropriate
application manifest file either next to your executable or embedded as a
resource.

You can copy one of the application manifest files that come with the examples.

IMPORTANT: Do not launch your executable before the manifest file is in place.
If you do anyway, the program will not run properly. And worse, Windows will not
recognize a manifest file, you later drop next to the executable. To fix this,
rebuild your executable and only launch it with a manifest file in place.
